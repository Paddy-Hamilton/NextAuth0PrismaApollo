# Courses

Courses is a video tutorial platform aiming to help beginner coders improve their skills and get a job in software development! Every course focuses on super practical problems often faced in the workplace!

## Why

There are a huge range of resources online to learn software development, but what they lack is a cohesive pathway into the industry.

Courses is designed to be this pathway!

Every course - both free and paid - is designed to build your problem solving skills and create some familiarity with the kinds of things you will really work on as a software developer!

### Dashboard

Really enjoy what you learnt? Subscribe to access every course!

### Subscribe
